# DEFEATING JASMINE

//<link Deploy>


## Description

Every IronHacker knows that Jasmine can be [pause] ~moody~ sometimes. She LOVES throwing errors! 

In this game you can Defeat Jasmine just by bringing some green check signs to the right side of the board. 

But be aware! Jasmine is not going to let you win this battle so easily. She will throw you some erros ‚ùå along the way, there will be bugs üêù ü¶ü üêõ and a lot of breaks üïë to take on your path.


## MVP (DOM - CANVAS)

- game has errors and bugs falling off the top of the canvas 
- check sign of the left needs to be dragged from the left and dropped at the right side of the screen
