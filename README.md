In this game you can Defeat Jasmine just by grabbing some green check signs and taking breaks to increase your time. 

But be aware! Jasmine is not going to let you win this battle so easily. She will throw you some erros ‚ùå along the way, there will be bugs üêù ü¶ü üêõ and a lot of breaks üïë to take on your path.
